Welcome to Chaim's house!
=========================

These configuration management scripts (Puppet Enterprise) are designed to manage my computers at home, so that I can learn how to manage an environment I care about with Puppet.

Obviously you've found your way here so you know that the code is open source. Which version, you may ask? I prefer [GNU GPLv3.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

Happy coding!
